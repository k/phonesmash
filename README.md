There are two kinds of people in this world: otterbox-clutching helmet-hair enthusiasts -- and Phonesmash champions. This game is not for the faint of heart. So put on your game face and make sure your iPhone has its affairs in order.

Navigate to phonesma.sh on your iPhone, enter your unique session ID and throw your phone -- we do the rest. Using socket.io, accelerometer data and good old fashioned javascript, we start a timer as soon as your 4G pride and joy takes flight. Catch the phone, or let the floor catch it, and we calculate your airtime. Try to beat your high score or challenge friends in a shared game room, but remember: there are no re-dos.
